LSE is a heatmap on the simplex. Can use surfaces.

could do with elliptic 4,1
    Cross ratio should have some interpretation?
    Faces of the triangle would be kind of like upper half space horizons
    Hyperbolas would be geodesics if metric maker was behind you. Since they're not they're defined by a face

Hessian, laplacian

cross ratio is defined for edges, what is it for a face?

same with hyperbolic distance

Examples
    Amount of income tax, amount of sales tax
    Adding salt, pepper, oregano
    Exploration vs Exploitation
    offence vs defence in football

vertices = policies

Point in the simplex = 

Make surfaces for the entropy and logsumexp
